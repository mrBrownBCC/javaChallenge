# Java Challenge
For this assignment, you will practice creating small functions that help you solve a challenge. 
I recommend using https://www.w3schools.com/java/ as a resource to brush up on Java syntax.

(challenges 1, 4, and 5)

### The assignment
Create a function and test it for each of the following challenges:

#### 1 Word reversal
For this challenge, the input is a string of words, and the output should be the words in reverse but with the letters in the original order. For example, the string “Dog bites man” should output as “man bites Dog.” 

After you’ve solved this challenge, try adding sentence capitalization and punctuation to your code. So, the string “ProgrammingIII is the best!” should output as “Best the is ProgrammingIII!”

#### 2 Anagrams
Two words are anagrams if they contain the same letters but in a different order. Here are a few examples of anagram pairs:

“listen” and “silent”
“binary” and “brainy”
“Paris” and “pairs”
For a given input of two strings, return a Boolean TRUE if the two strings are anagrams.

As an added challenge, for a given array of strings, return separate lists that group anagrams together. For example, the input {“tar,” “rat,” “art,” “meats,” “steam”}, the output should look something like {[“tar,” “rat,” “art”], [“meats,” “steam”]}.

#### 3 Pangrams
A pangram is a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet. One of the most well-known examples of a pangram is, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” Create a pangram checker that returns a Boolean TRUE if an input string is a pangram and FALSE if it isn’t.

For an added pangram challenge, create a perfect pangram checker. A perfect pangram is a sentence that uses each letter of the alphabet only once, such as, “Mr. Jock, TV quiz Ph.D., bags few lynx.”

### Setup command
N/A

### Test command
N/A - your code will be graded manually. Just click the run button to run your code.

### Notes
- This is the first time running this project - so some things may take some time to figure out! 
If the challenges are more difficult than anticipated the due date will be extended.
